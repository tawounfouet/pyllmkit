# PyLLMKit

**Status:** Phase 1 Domain Core is technically qualified on feature branches; architectural G0 closure and integration are in progress. The metadata version `0.1.0a1` is an **unpublished alpha candidate**.

PyLLMKit models provider-agnostic LLM primitives as typed Python domain objects, separate from model-serving providers, deployments and inference APIs.

## What is implemented in Phase 1

- **L1.1:** Model, ModelId, ModelIdentity, ModelFamily, ModelVersion, ModelVariant, ModelRevision, ModelArchitecture, ModelLimits, ModelArtifact, typed provider alias, JSON codec.
- **L1.2:** Capability, CapabilitySupport, SupportLevel, CapabilityConstraint, CapabilitySet, Modality, ModalitySet; composed within Model.
- **L1.3:** offline tests and architecture fitness checks, reproducible examples, coverage reporting, typing, lint, isolated wheel and sdist installation, traceability and M1 review.

## Quick start

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
python -m ruff check .
python -m mypy src/pyllmkit
python -m pytest -q --cov=pyllmkit.domain --cov-branch --cov-report=term-missing
python examples/01_define_model.py
python examples/02_define_artifacts.py
python examples/03_define_capabilities.py
python -m build
```

The domain core has no mandatory provider SDK dependencies. The tests remove common LLM credential environment variables and reject socket connection/bind attempts; the test fixture is not a machine-wide network sandbox.

## Domain example

```python
from pyllmkit.domain import (\n    Capability, CapabilityId, CapabilitySet, CapabilitySupport,\n    Model, ModelFamily, ModelId, ModelIdentity, Modality, ModalitySet, SupportLevel,\n)

model = Model(
    id=ModelId("example/vision"),
    identity=ModelIdentity(ModelFamily("example")),
    capabilities=CapabilitySet((
        Capability(CapabilityId("vision"), CapabilitySupport(SupportLevel.NATIVE)),
    )),
    modalities=ModalitySet(
        input_modalities=frozenset({Modality("text"), Modality("image")}),
        output_modalities=frozenset({Modality("text")}),
    ),
)
assert model.supports(CapabilityId("vision"))
assert model.modalities.can_output(Modality("image")) is False
```

## Architecture & documentation

```text
Applications -> Facade -> Application Services -> Ports/Protocols
                                 |                    ^
                                 v                    |
                             Domain Core <---------- Adapters
```

**This is a conceptual invocation view**, not a Python import graph. The Domain Core does not depend on facade, adapters, SDKs, network or credentials. Capabilities and Modalities must not depend on the Model Entity. For source-code rules see `docs/architecture/dependencies.md`.

- ADR: `docs/adr/` (accepted for the Phase 1 alpha under delegated milestone authorization; future revisions require a new decision).

## Explicitly not included

No provider invocation, serving Deployment/Endpoint, registry, streaming, RAG, agent orchestration or tool-execution engine in Phase 1. The Python package is not a released, stable LLM client.

**License: MIT** (see `LICENSE` and ADR-007). Publication remains a separate decision after a successful M1 gate.
